# Changelog

PASS follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/). This file records
user-visible changes to the PASS factory contract. Individual SkillForge
skillsets may evolve independently.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Added a dedicated Software Engineering Drill protocol that separates
  portability probes, blind sittings, deterministic regressions, and comparative
  studies.
- Added contamination stop conditions, single-pair checkpoints, and explicit
  sub-agent concurrency and run ceilings for empirical work.
- Added a derived SE Drill inventory command and a self-testing C++ Drill packet
  that exercises compile-success and expected-compile-failure evidence.

## 1.0.0-beta.2 - 2026-09-06

### Changed

- Generalized code-corpus measurement from hardcoded C and C++ handling to
  explicit C, C++, Go, Python, and Rust language profiles.
- Excluded conventional test files, Rust inline test modules, and testing
  frameworks' own assertion macros from production-code measurements while
  retaining qualified production assertion macros.
- Retired the obsolete Art pressure harness after blind Drills replaced its
  evaluation role.

### Evidence

- Reproduced the recorded C, C++, and Rust density baselines with the current
  instrument and named the corpora behind those figures.
- Recorded a new blind agent-authored corpus measurement, including the result
  that assertion density alone could not distinguish the compared samples.

## 1.0.0-beta.1 - 2026-09-06

First formal public beta. Earlier development was not assigned public SemVer
releases.

### Added

- Portable PASS authoring, schema, validation, memory, project-snapshot, import,
  runtime, and release-building workflows.
- Python-capable chat project snapshots for Art, Game Design, Software
  Engineering, and Writing.
- Self-contained SkillForge releases for all four current domains.
- Split AGPL-3.0-or-later and CC BY-SA 4.0 licensing, contribution guidance,
  attribution, project-name protection, and community support links.
- A documented Drill model for AI training and evaluation, with future
  AI-guided human teaching identified as a separate maturity target.

### Beta compatibility notice

The intended `1.0.0` public surface is now documented. Incompatible corrections
may still occur during beta, but they must receive a new prerelease version and
release notes. Published version contents are not replaced silently.
